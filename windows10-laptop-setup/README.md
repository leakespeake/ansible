# Windows 10 Laptop Setup

The purpose of this Ansible project is to automate (as much as possible) the software installation, updates and configuration for my Windows 10 development laptop and covers the following 2 local environments;

- Windows 10 Home (OS)
- Ubuntu 20.04 (WSL2)

This will become useful to re-create my development environment in the event that I switch to or use additional hardware.
